	"Exousia is known as an enormous authoritarian empire, currently ruled by the Lionheart Emperor, Zelheim. The Empire is divided into a few major powers, the Sovereign, the Imperial Army, the Imperial Police, and the Church of Dunamis. Whist the Empire is at peace with most other factions, many fear the Empire's massive military power and maintain a cautious relationship with Exousians."
