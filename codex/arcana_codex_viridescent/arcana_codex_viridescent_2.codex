    "The Gelsemis is a race of evolved plant-humanoids. Having adapted the Viridescent's toxic environments, the Gelsemis are resilient to any poison and acid. Despite sharing similar features to the Florans, the Gelsemis also tend to not engage in bloodshed or combat unless it's absolutely necessary. Most Gelsemis currently still reside in the toxic cities of the Viridescent."
